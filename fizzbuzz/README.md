# Fizzbuzz

## Description:

The goal of **FizzBuzz** is to print a sequence of numbers, but with a twist:

* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz."
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz."
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
* Otherwise, print the number itself.
