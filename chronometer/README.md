# CHRONOMETER

## Description:

<!-- Task List is a JavaScript-based program that allows users to quickly and easily make a To-Do list. It counts with the date and time, and it is also possible to edit your tasks and/or delete them. It uses the local storage in your computer so it's also possible to save your list for later. -->

## How to Use
<!-- 1. Write your task in the "New Task" input section.
2. Add your tasks by pressing/clicking on the "Add Task" button or the "+" in case of smaller devices, pressing "Enter" works too.
3. If you want to edit your task simply click/press twice on it and edition mode will be on, to save it just press "Enter" or click/press somewhere else.
4. Click/press the "Check" icon to change the status of a task to "Done", you can also click/press the "Trash Can" icon to delete it.
5. You can order your task so the "Done" ones go to the bottom of the list (this will not be stored).
